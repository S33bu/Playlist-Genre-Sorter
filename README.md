# Playlist-Genre-Sorter
This tool extracts songs from a specified playlist that match a user-defined genre and adds them to another playlist.

Note: The current version requires manual changes to certain variables in the code for it to function properly. (Future updates may address this.)

Important: Spotify assigns genres to artists rather than individual songs. As a result, the genre matching may not always be precise, since an artistâ€™s profile genre might not reflect the genre of every song they produce.
